She is the second woman to land the quadruple toe loop after training partner and teammate Alexandra Trusova, the fourth woman to land a quadruple jump of any kind, the 16th woman to land a triple Axel, and the third woman to land a triple Axel and quadruple jump in the same program after Alysa Liu and training partner and teammate Sofia Akateva.

She has one pet dog, a Pomeranian named Lëva (Lyova), gifted to her in 2019 by fans. Valieva was enrolled in gymnastics, ballet, and figure skating classes at an early age by her mother but was encouraged to focus solely on skating after turning five. She named Nathan Chen as one of the skaters whose technique and ability she admires. Along with her teammate Alexandra Trusova, she prefers to use white Edea skating boots with silver blades in competition.
